# Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 1

  One of my favorite labs was our first one, Lab 1. My groupmate was super chill, and we both helped each other learn a lot. Being able to create a cout statement that printed "Hello world" was a big step in the learning process. Overall, this code served as a simple starting point for someone new to programming in C++ to grasp the fundamental components of a basic program and how to print output to the console.

* Lab 10, Part 1:

  Another one of my favorite labs was Lab 10, part 1. The program was designed to read a file containing integers, check if each integer and its reverse are prime numbers, and then print the prime integers to the console. The program defines a function, IsPrime, which determines whether a given integer is prime. I enjoyed the lab since it helped me learn more about I/O, string manipulation, and prime number checking. The learning objective of this code was a program that reads integers from a file, checks if each integer and its reverse are prime, and prints the prime integers. It covered various fundamental concepts in programming, including file I/O, string manipulation, function usage, and error handling.

* Lab 4, Part 2:

  My last favorite lab was Lab 4, part 2. The program helps beginners understand basic programming ideas using the C++ language. In the game, one player thinks of a secret number, and the other player tries to guess it. I just thought it was really interesting to learn about coding a guessing game. It was fun to code and revise for errors. This code provided a hands-on exercise for beginners to practice foundational programming skills and gain familiarity with basic syntax and logic structures in C++.
